*Create a factory that includes Manager, employees (Worker) and *Director.
a. loops, conditions - adding employees, displaying currently working (what they do),
getting orders from the user.
b. OOP - all employees (including the director), inherit from the common class
(Employee). Each employee may have a work tool (e.g. Hammer, Laptop,
PointingFinger).
c. collections - appropriate grouping of data
d. * threads - use the while loop only to receive orders from the user, use the threads
to display status / modify each object.
e. ** additional functionalities â€“ e.g. displaying information about who and how much
has earned since the beginning of work (counting every few seconds), "deduct in
succession" - sorted list of employees (by name), employee data can be loaded from
the file at the beginning.
f. ** support for the Director class - displaying information "everybody works - great!",
"where is <name> ?!" (e.g. if the employee has left earlier).
